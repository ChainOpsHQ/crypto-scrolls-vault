## üõ†Ô∏è Smart Contract Functions

### Core Operations
```solidity
// Create encrypted bounty
function createBounty(
    string memory title,
    string memory description,
    euint32 reward,
    euint32 difficulty,
    ebool isEncrypted,
    uint256 deadline
) external returns (uint256);

// Submit encrypted solution
function submitSolution(
    uint256 bountyId,
    euint32 quality,
    ebool isAnonymous,
    string memory solutionHash
) external returns (uint256);

// Claim rewards anonymously
function claimReward(uint256 bountyId) external;
```

### Privacy Features
- **Encrypted Data Types**: `euint32`, `euint8`, `ebool`
- **Homomorphic Operations**: Add, compare, select on encrypted data
- **Anonymous Transactions**: No identity linkage possible
- **Zero-Knowledge Verification**: Prove completion without revealing details
